## TL;DR

[**Hint.css**][hint-css] is FREE again after being a paid product for nearly 3.5 years! ðŸ¥³

## Back Story

[Hint.css][hint-css] is a CSS library I built back in 2013. It is a CSS-only solution to create tooltips. After it launched, it quickly gained
 a lot of traction, thousands of [stars on Github][gh], was twice (ðŸ¥¶) on the [homepage of][hn1] [HackerNews][hn2], [featured on ProductHunt][ph] and mentioned on countless websites.
It was launched under the MIT license and was free to use, no matter how you used it.

In 2016 I decided to monetize it. I came across a resource aggregation website called Uplabs which had also started its own marketplace. It was still free
for personal projects. But if you did use it in a commercial projects, a license had to be purchased. I decided to monetize it 
for a number of reasons:

- It was a very popular tooltip library
- I had never monetized any of my product before. I wanted to try it out.
- Who doesn't want a few bucks from a side-project! ðŸ˜¬

## And Today

After a period of 3.5 years I have finally decided to make it free again! Here is why I have made this decision:

- It has not been getting too much sales recently. There is a life of every product on a marketplace.
- I think it has earned me enough, considering it was a few hours project! (A some days of maintenance) ðŸ˜ƒ

## The Fun Part

Okay, now the interesting part. How much did it earn me!! I have experimented a lot over the years with its pricing. I don't have 
an exact count of the number of sales (Uplabs doesn't give that). But till date Hint.css has made **$1902.88** in sales!
