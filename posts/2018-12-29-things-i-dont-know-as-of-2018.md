This post is inspired by [Dan Abramov's post](https://overreacted.io/things-i-dont-know-as-of-2018/) where he lists out, yes, things he doesn't know as of 2018. On top of Dan's reasons, I am also writing this post to myself get clarity on the things I don't fully understand and things I want to learn next year. So here goes...

- **CSS Grid** - I know I know, Grids are the best. Hard to believe, but I haven't used CSS Grids even once in any project yet. I have tinkered with them, but haven't got any practical need to use them over Flexbox.
- **Accessibility** - I started focusing a lot on Web Accessibility (a11y) in 2017, thanks to my friend [Jitendra Vyas](https://twitter.com/jitendravyas). I take care about <abbr title="Accessibility">a11y</abbr> in whatever I develop now. But the domain is very huge and there are many aspect I still need to learn about <abbr title="Accessibility">a11y</abbr> (inspect me :)).
- **Responsive web design** (RWD) - I feel I lack the right approach towards <abbr title="Responsive web design">RWD</abbr>. Whatever I implement still feels hacky and not-robust to me.
- **Docker performance** - I started with Docker in late 2017 and have worked quite a bit. But the end results have been intolerably slow as far as performance is concerned. I still have to learn the internals of containers to have usable architectures over Docker.
- **Backend** - I am a frontend developer and though I have worked a few times over backend code, I still am afraid to write one from scratch or maintain backend code. That is also the reason why my app [Web Maker](https://webmakerapp.com) is completely serverless till date - hosted on Github pages and running serverless functions wherever required.
- **React patterns** - I have tried React over 2-3 projects now. In fact I re-wrote [Web Maker](https://webmakerapp.com) completely in [Preact](https://preactjs.com/) (lighter React) [this year](https://medium.com/web-maker/web-maker-is-now-in-preact-85af98be8683). But I feel my code could be much more concise and manageable if I know the many patterns out there.
- **Typing without looking at the keyboard** - I still can't type correctly without looking at the keyboard for even a minute ðŸ˜… Moreover, I got a new keyboard and my type speed has severely downgraded!
- **SEO** - Hardly know anything (maybe a point or two) in this space.

Now some non-tech things:

- **Being productive** - I feel I have started procrastinating more and more ðŸ˜› Even more since I quit my job to become an indie developer. I need to get back on track soon and start shipping and learning.
- **Playing chords on Piano** - I am able to figure out chords for a lot of music, but still not close to 100%.
- **Go to post something on twitter and get back without checking out my timeline** - self-explanatory ðŸ˜”.

### TODO 2019

Finally here are few things I want to do in 2019:

- Release 4 products that earn me money.
- Deep dive more into Web Accessibility.
- Launch the educational website I have been wanting to start (for years!).
- Get my left hand to play without seeing on Piano. More practice required.
- Draw more.
- Stay like a kid :)
